          <p>We competed at and won the Virginia and Chesapeake Regionals. We advanced to the championships in St. Louis, Missouri once again, reaching the quarterfinals of our division. We hosted the off-season event Rumble in the Roads in October, attracting
            27 regional teams. In December, we participated in Salvation Army bell ringing at Patrick Henry Mall.</p>

          <p>We competed at the Virginia and Chesapeake Regionals. Although defeated in the finals at the Virginia Regional, we left the Chesapeake regional as winners. We participated in the championship in St. Louis, Missouri, reaching the division finals.
            In the summer, we made an appearance at NASA’s “Exploration Days” at Busch Gardens, Williamsburg. We later held “Robot Saturdays”, collaborating with team 122 to demonstrate our robots the Virginia Air and Space Center's visitors. We later
            hosted the offseason event Rumble in the Roads at Menchville High School.</p>

          <p>We participated in the Virginia and Palmetto Regionals. We built a practice field at the Virginia Air and Space Center for the use of teams around Hampton Roads and participated in the FIRST-sponsored state-wide meeting for team competitiveness.
            We also branched out to Lee Hall Elementary School, where we started the FIRST team The Engineers.</p>

          <h3>Rebound Rumble</h3>
          <p>We were invited to demonstrate our robot at a city-wide STEM Summit this year, which focused on the new integrated STEM aspects of the classroom curriculum. Our robot demo was used to highlight the curriculum used in robotic design. In 2012,
            we supported the creation of the FLL team Bricks 'N Bots, ran by a private group. We supported the team with robot kits, programming and mechanical instructions, and grants for them to travel and compete.</p>

          <h3>Logo Motion</h3>
          <p>We built Genome Gamma to play the game Logomotion. We competed in the Palmetto Regional and won both the event and the Engineering Excellence award. We also competed in the Virginia Regional, making it to finals and winning the Industrial Design
            award. Our head coach Matt Wilbur won the Woodie Flowers award. We made a great showing at the St. Louis World Championship and advanced to the quarter finals.</p>

          <h3>Breakaway</h3>
          <p>We competed at the Washington DC and Virginia Regionals. We finished the Washington DC Regional with 7 wins and 2 losses, but were not selected to compete in the elimination matches. However, we continued our winning streak by receiving the
            Underwriters' Laboratory Industrial Safety Award for the second year in a row. At the Virginia Regional, we once again performed well and were finally selected by the number 8 alliance as a competitor for the elimination matches. The alliance
            was eliminated in the quarter- final matches, but we had broken through and finally made it into the elimination rounds! We capped off the competition was by receiving the Motorola Quality Award as the judges recognized the quality build of
            our robot, Genome Beta.

          <h3>Lunacy</h3>
          <p>We made great strides in 2009, competing in the New Jersey and NASA/VCU Regionals. We finished the New Jersey Regional with 4 wins and 3 losses- 37th place out of 61 teams. At the NASA/VCU Regional, we finished with 5 wins and 2 losses- 15th
            place out of 60 teams. Unfortunately, no team selected us to partner with them for the elimination matches, and we were poised to go home disappointed. However, hard work once again paid off, as we won the Underwriters' Laboratory Industiral
            Safety Award.
